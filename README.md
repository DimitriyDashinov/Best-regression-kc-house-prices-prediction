# Predicting House Prices in King County

This multivariate linear regression project was completed as part of Flatiron School's Data Science Bootcamp (Module 2 Final Project).

## Problem statement

In April 2020, estate agent ABC commisions a research project investigating house sales in King County to help shape a future targeted campaign. 

The project seeks to provide data-driven insights into the factors which influence the house price and presents a linear regression model which can accurately predict the sale price of a house in the area.

## Components

* **Jupyter Notebook**

The [Jupyter Notebook](TBD) is our key deliverable and contains details of our approach and methodology, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and model building and validation.

I recommend using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view the Jupyter Notebook.

* **Presentation**

The presentation gives a high-level overview of our approach, findings and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. It is aimed to be between 5 and 10 minutes long. There are two files, [with](TBD) and [without](TBD) presenter notes.

* **Data**

The dataset can be found in the file *"kc_house_data.csv"*, in this repository. It was originally provided in the following [repository](https://github.com/learn-co-students/dsc-mod-2-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-pt-012120).

* **Blog Post**

A [blog post](TBD) was created as part of this project.
